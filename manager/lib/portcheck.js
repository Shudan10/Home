 * Nothing inside the network can answer that question. A request from here to
 * this connection's own public address either loops back inside the router or
 * is dropped by it, and neither outcome says anything about what a stranger
 * would find. So the only honest test asks something on the internet to try the
 * connection, and this asks check-host.net, which exists for that and needs no
 * account.
 *
 * That means telling a third party this machine's address. It is the same

 * already sees, and the check only runs when somebody presses the button, but
 * the panel says so before it does it.
