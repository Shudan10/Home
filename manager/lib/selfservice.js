 * and the remaining steps never happen.
 *
 * So both hand off to a detached container that outlives this one. It is the
 * usual shape for this: the thing being replaced starts its replacement and
 * then stops mattering.
 *
 * Both mount the stack at its *host* path rather than at /stack. The docker CLI
 * resolves build contexts and volume sources itself, so a path that only exists
 * inside this container yields a build quietly made from the wrong files.
 * Mounting host-path onto the same host-path makes the CLI and the daemon agree.
